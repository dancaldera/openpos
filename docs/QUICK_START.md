- `src/services/customers-sqlite.ts` - Customer service (750+ lines)
- `src/pages/Customers.tsx` - Customer UI (870+ lines)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` - This progress document
- `docs/QUICK_START.md` - This quick start guide

## What's Next?

### Translation Status
Customer translations currently ship in the implemented locales only:
- `apps/desktop/src/locales/en.json`
- `apps/desktop/src/locales/es.json`
- Spanish (es.json)
- French (fr.json)
- German (de.json)
- Italian (it.json)
- Portuguese (pt.json)
- Chinese (zh.json)
- Japanese (ja.json)

### Recommended Next Phase: Product Variants (24-30 hours)
Enables:
- Size, color, prescription variations
- Weight-based products for butcher shops
- Prescription attributes for optics
- Fractional stock (kg, lb, oz)
- SKU generation per variant

**Why this phase?**
- Critical for optics and butcher shop support
- Enables core multi-industry functionality
- Higher complexity benefits from early attention

### Alternative: Dynamic Categories (8-10 hours)
If you prefer a quicker win:
- Replace hardcoded product categories
- Admin UI for category management
- Industry-specific category sets
- Lower complexity

---

## Performance Notes

- **Indexes:** Added on all searchable fields
- **Search:** Debounced for better performance

## Known Limitations

1. **Translations:** Only English is complete (7 languages pending)
2. **Order Editing:** Cannot change customer after order creation
3. **Customer Deletion:** Soft delete only (recoverable)
4. **Loyalty Points:** Manual management only (not auto-calculated yet)
5. **Purchase History:** Tracked but no dedicated UI yet

---

## Troubleshooting

### Database Migration Failed
- Check: Migration already applied?
- Solution: Migrations are idempotent, safe to re-run

### Customer Number Not Generated
- Check: Database connection
- Check: Console for errors
- Last resort: Manually set to "CUST-XXXXX" format

### Orders Not Showing Customer
- Check: Migration 15 applied?
- Check: Order created after migration?
- Note: Old orders won't have customer_id (backward compatible)

### Permissions Error on Customers Page
- Check: Logged in as Manager or Admin?
- Check: User role in database
- Solution: Use admin@postpos.com / 123456
